# Output Roadmap

Signal outputs translate presence status into real-world signals. Upcoming targets:

- BusyLight / KUANDO: USB presence light indicator.
- MQTT / Home Assistant: publish status topics for automations.

These folders are scaffolds only; implementations will land in future versions.
